# Usage

To use the AppImage, simply download the file and make it executable.

The AppImage will create it's own CONFIG file in the folder where it is run,
just as the other means of running the program will.

For this reason it is suggested you place the AppImage in it's own folder.
For instance ~/Recipe-Scribe
